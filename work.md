# Doing well at your job

Full disclaimer, when I first joined my job. My goal was to optimize 

> Salary / hours worked

So I was trying to coast on 20 hrs of work a week, and live my life by eating fancy dinners in NYC, partying, etc. But I quickly realized, that 

* I wasn't making that much (maybe NYC issue)
* My career was not progressing that fast (shocker)
* It was not fulfilling 

I eventually left my team, and joined an infra team, that had lots of scope, good managers, and people I enjoyed working with. And I have worked a lot harder since.

That is my story, but I am not trying to convince you to work harder. That is up to you. I am trying to warn you against doing dumb things I did, and also how to potentially make better choices in your career.

## Choosing a team

Above all, your manager is important at work. I was also told this, so why didn't I get it?
Well, because I'm not that smart so I didn't understand what they meant. So here is my attempt to make it very explicit to you.

The most fundamental fact is that, your manager has the most direct influence on whether to fire or promote you. So, if you have a good relationship with your manager, you will have a good time at work. Otherwise, not so good.

Other than that, your manager decides what work you do, who you work with, and how people see you. So, if you have a manager that doesn't care? You will get bad work, other people will not think highly of you, and you will not have a great time. A good manager will give you good work, that is impactful, and when promotion time comes, is easy to argue in favor of your performance.

A good manager, if you're an entry level engineer, should also be able to do your job. If you don't feel this way, your manager is not technically competent, and although it works in certain circumstances and at higher levels, as an entry-level, I don't really see how a manager that doesn't connect with you on the basic skills can manage you effectively.

The other "hack" to look for on a team or org, is to look at the levels of people. Are there a lot of senior people? Is there a lot of turnover? If you don't see a lot of senior people, maybe there is no path up. If you are surrounded by senior people all the time, you will naturally gain their skills, and become their level quicker. If everyone around you is junior, who are you going to learn from?

Finally, your team has to be important. Usually, there is a theme in industry that people highly tout. Right now, that is Generative AI, so that is probably a safe bet. Otherwise, you can choose a team that is well-established, like Ads at Facebook, since they are the money generator for the company. At the end of the day, the test you can do for team is, **do they make money for the company?**

## How much to work

You should work as much as you need to get your job done. That varies at different times and positions, but generally if you are ambitious, there is work ahead of you, and you can do as much as you want.

In terms of stages of career, you should really work hard when you are at a lower level. Not just because you might have more time (no wife, no kids), but because it is objectively easier to get promoted as a junior level engineer than a senior level engineer. So, the amount of benefit you get out of working marginally harder at the junior level is rewarded a lot more than at the senior level.

## Don't be afraid of your manager

People always talk about "transparent feedback" at work. What you should care about is:

> Do I know how I am doing?

If you can't answer this question, you are likely in a danger zone.

The easiest way to get out of this is, just ask your manager! It's not very hard, just ask your manager how you are doing, if there is any feedback, and if there is anything you can be doing better. I was scared to do this early on, which is normal, but if you get used to it, it will become easier. Remember, your manager cares about you doing well as much as you do.

## If you have an accent

We learn about not being biased at work all the time. But what I've observed is, if you don't have good English skills, you will not make it up high. Either your communication is hampered by your skills, or people won't take you seriously. As much as people in tech don't like to believe optics matter, they do! That's why we have our five senses. So, if you feel that you are lacking in any of those optics, appearance, reputation, accent...it is worth investing in.
